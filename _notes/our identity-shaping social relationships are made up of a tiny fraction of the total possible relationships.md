title: our identity-shaping social relationships are made up of a tiny fraction of the total possible relationships

It's pretty obvious that the people we interact with the most in our day-to-day lives greatly influences who we become. Although I just made the connection between this and that of content consumption.

Just like how [[the worldview shaping content we consume is an infinitesimal fraction of the total available content]], so too do our current social relationships make up but a tiny fraction.

It can also be thought of in another way: continuously searching for social relationship, as the ripples of these efforts fade quickly. What I mean here is that there's really no reason to "fear" social awkwardness or failure, or to only want to fall into the same patterns of interaction. Try new things and experiment. You will hardly make a dent in the long run anyway, and there will always be new people to meet that have no idea of your previous social relationships.

This can also relate to Cynefin as well. What are the energy gradients of social interactions?

Of all the possible social relationships, which are the most likely and require the least amount of energy?

Now imagine if a company like Facebook (Meta) used all it's psychographic mapping to do just this.

Just like [[curation as a new modality of wisdom in the information age]], it requires a degree of wisdom to *curate* friendships.

We all need to act as memetic bridges, interacting with the people close enough to our narrow slice that there is overlap, enough for worldviews to *actually* change. Thinking of a map, a topology of clusters, if they are too separate then whats even the point.
