Zettelkasten is like an amplified self-reflection journal. By structuring notes into a web format where the ideas can evolve over time and acquire new content ([[evergreen notes should expand over time with new and relevant information]]) and contribute to new ideas and trains of thought ([[long-form arguments are just strings of evergreen notes]]), one becomes much more acquainted with their own thoughts and ideas. 

It enables self-reflection and internal conversations to explore depths difficult to attain without the zettelkasten method. What is interesting, is how it can spread this self-relationship out over time. It enable past ideas and thoughts to mingle with present ideas and thoughts, and sets them up to connect with any future ideas and thoughts ([[evergreen notes should be written with my future-self in mind]]). Essentially, [[zettelkasten spreads one's mind across time]].

It opens the space for an ongoing dialogue with ideas that I had thought about in the past. Without something like zettelkasten, I would have no straightforward way of returning to any insight my past self managed to stumble on. For example, during my [research project working with the HoloLens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc2JlbQPhmY), I am sure that I had many interesting, well articulated thoughts, but, they were not stored in a way that facilitates ongoing discussions with such ideas.
