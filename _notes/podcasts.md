Podcasts are one of the main ways I continue to expand my understanding of the world we live in. They add an incredible amount of value to my life and have quite literally [changed it](https://medium.com/livingsystemsnetwork/from-volunteer-gardening-to-building-next-gen-distributed-web-apps-my-journey-to-holochain-app-94088da21c50) as well.

Here, you can find a list of some of my favourite podcasts, along with several others that I listen to once in a while whenever I find the time.

## favourites / most consistently listened to
- [The Great Simplification with Nate Hagens](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/)
	- A deep dive into ecological economics from a retired Wall Street fund manager. A main focus on the "carbon pulse", "energy blindness", the role of cheap, abundant energy resources play in our modern world, and how our global financial systems are fundamentally decoupled from the physical reality of our planet. He foresees a "great simplification" of our global economy because of these factors and aims to educate his audience about these future possibilities.
- [Your Undivided Attention](https://www.humanetech.com/podcast)
	- From the creators of [The Social Dilemma](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/). A broad analysis of the business models of social media and other big tech companies (AKA "the attention economy"). From how these affects teen mental health to creating new geopolitical and national security threats to polarizing society and weakening democracy across the world.
- [The Jim Rutt Show](https://jimruttshow.blubrry.net/)
	- "**_The Jim Rutt Show_** is a podcast series examining cutting edge thinking in science and technology with regard to the future of our economy, our political systems, and our social systems. Each interview covers a short list of critical topics in great depth. Jim Rutt has a reputation for not letting people get by on talking points. He [provokes real conversations](https://www.wired.com/2001/09/pioneer-steps-out-of-net-rutt/) with the leading thinkers, writers, and doers who are shaping the future of the planet."
