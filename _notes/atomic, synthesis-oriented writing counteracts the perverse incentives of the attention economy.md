I've written previously about the indirect benefits [[zettelkasten]] style [[networked note-taking]] has on counteracting the negative impacts of the [[attention economy]], like how [[zettelkasten provides a space for deep, contextual, and nuanced thinking]]. But, there are even more direct benefits.

As noted, [[the broad impacts of the attention economy's perverse incentives alters widespread communication patterns]]. This affects us all. I even notice in myself an almost subconscious inclination to use inflammatory, attention-grabbing titles for my own writing or social media posts, with the aim of garnering more attention.

What's great about atomic, synthesis-oriented writing (following the principle that [[each zettel should be a unit of thought]]) is that it forces us to develop titles that capture the essence of each note. That is, the title itself is sufficient to capture the contents of a note, providing the reader (usually my future self: [[zettelkasten enables one to have a more in depth relationship with their past, present, and future self]]) an accurate and non-manipulative summary.

These kinds of synthesis-oriented titles are almost wholly lacking from the media landscape at large. So often we come across ridiculous titles like: "**WATCH THIS: corrupt politician gets DESTROYED!!!**", whereas a more accurate, synthesis title would be something along the lines of: "**unnecessarily long video capturing an occasionally heated debate between two politicians with condescending and nuance-collapsing 3rd party commentary**". In other words, zettelkasten can help us think in an more anti-polarized way: [[anti-polarization as a civic virtue]].

Just imagine an [[epistemic commons]] where large numbers of people, especially intellectually-oriented content creators, contributed to an atomic, synthesis-oriented knowledge graph ([[semantic graphs as a way to annotate and index our collective thinking]]). This is what something like [[agora]] could become in some ways, or at least bootstrap the development of one.
