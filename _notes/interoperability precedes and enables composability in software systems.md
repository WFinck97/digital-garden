I often think of interoperability as being an advantage and selling point of web3 technologies like [[Holochain]], [[Neighbourhoods]], and [[AD4M]]. But, interoperability is not the whole story. It is simply a means to an end, that end being *composability*.

We make software systems (application microservices, micromodules, widgets, ad4m languages, etc.) interoperable such that they can be *composed together*, creating new kinds of applications and systems. In fact, it creates a new kind of *environment* for applications to be developed within: [[extending the compositional nature of programming to digital social coordination environments]].

Could this kind of software development model sufficiently harness the distributed talent of developers around the world? That is to say, [[can open networks actually outcompete multinational corporations?]]

This is where some of the real web3 innovation will disrupt existing business model, by enabling [[horizontal open network value flows as an alternative to monolithic vertically integrated software systems]]. If things go well, [[holochain will enable an unprecedented evolution of open-source tools for developing all sorts of applications]].
