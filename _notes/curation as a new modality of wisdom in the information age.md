#wisdom #information-curation

When I think about wise people, I think about old men with beards. People that lived long ago. People that lived in worlds of direct experience. Back in the day of Socrates, for example, most information likely existed through conversation. To acquire knowledge meant to experience the outside world and engage in dialogue with others. We now live in a much different world, one where [[curated information can influence worldview development more than direct experiences]].

It makes me think that there is a new modality of wisdom: one which is correlate with ones curation abilities. That is to say, how well can one seek existing wisdom in the compute fabric of the internet? The amount of wisdom accessible is phenomenal, so long as one is able to find it and process it. PKM helps with this significantly: [[personal knowledge management is a way to process information for the purpose of creating knowledge that compounds throughout life]].

In a world of abundant information, what kind of algorithms (people curating and software-based) can orient us towards wisdom?

There is an abundance of incredible insight, wisdom, knowledge, freely, or very cheaply available, explained by the worlds greatest educators. PKM methods, approaches, frameworks, is a way to effectively navigate this novel information ecology. To find and internalize the bountiful insight, to use it to construct an ever-expanding worldview and deeper understanding of yourself and the world around you.
