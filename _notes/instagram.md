		- In this video I get interviewed by one of my team members of [Neighbourhoods](https://neighbourhoods.network/), a [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org/) project exploring P2P and distributed software architectures for digital social interactions free of 3rd party manipulation.
		- Not only do I talk about the project and our work, but I also talk a bit about my hobbies, interests, my favourite [[podcasts]], and thoughts on AI!
