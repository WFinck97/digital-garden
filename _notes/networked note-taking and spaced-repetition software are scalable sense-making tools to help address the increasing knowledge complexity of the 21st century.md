As argued in The Consilience Project article, "society needs to advance \[...\] its abilities and capabilities for leaning, in general and in perpetuity".[^1] We require a cultural enlightenment: [[an ethos of learning and epistemic humility are necessary cultural features for public sense-making to effectively navigate the complexity of hyperobjects]].

Knowing that [[our minds require external scaffolding to perform complex intellectual feats]], it's clear that external cognitive scaffolding will be a part of the solution to enhance societies capacity for learning. 

Two of the most effective methods that I am aware of for enhancing ones own capacity for learning are networked note-taking and spaced-repetition flashcards.

On the networked note-taking front, [[a graph is the most flexible, intuitive and least restrictive data structure for working with digital information]], which helps people hold many different thoughts and ideas and combine them in novel ways to help with learning.

Spaced repetition flashcards help with building long-term memory, which is important for many reasons, especially considering that [[memory of the basics is key to developing a deep understanding of complex topics]].
