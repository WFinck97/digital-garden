[[A-Challenges to Making Sense of the 21st Century]]

[[the increasing complexity of knowledge in the 21st century is outpacing current human capacity to learn]]. Additionally, [[adequate public sense-making is necessary for new institutions with the capacity to address the complexity of hyperobjects to emerge from the ground up]]. 

For effective sense-making in a world of hyperobjects and increasing knowledge complexity, people need to adopt epistemic humility and an ethos of learning. We need to be comfortable with uncertainty, as complex systems are inherently unpredictable and uncontrollable. Otherwise, we risk falling into either *hubristic denialism* or *nihilistic opportunism*, neither of which are adequate to effectively deal with the risks of hyperobjects. 

Adopting such a mindset is not trivial and comes with many mental challenges: [[the mental challenge of continuous learning and constant change]]. We can't only rely on individuals to take on this responsibility themselves, but to also ensure our institutions do it as well: [[an education system that prepares students for a world of constant change]].
