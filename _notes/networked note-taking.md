Networked note-taking is a form of note-taking (typically digital) where links can be made between any two notes in your note base. The structure of such a note-base becomes a graph, where nodes are individual notes and edges are links between them. This is great because [[a graph is the most flexible, intuitive and least restrictive data structure for working with digital information]].

The organizational structure typically comes from the graph rather than directory structure (which is a tree).

It's a lot like Wikipedia, except each page is your own note.
