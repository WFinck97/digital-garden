[[open source software is a modern example of scalable gift economics]]. But even so, developers still need to make a decent living through their main work, and open source projects likely rely on a lot of volunteer effort, rather than paid, primary focus work.

Both Neighbourhoods and Perspect3vism (along with others I'm sure) are pioneering new value flow systems that can ensure developers are fairly compensated for their efforts in creating interoperable and composable application micro-services. If these economic systems work out and developers have financial security by developing these kinds of software system, this would be a significant change to the incentive structure that locks the software industry into what it is today.

This is a great example of how [[current computer application paradigms are falsely limited by ideological constraints]].
