#zettelkasten 

---
From reading through [mental nodes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/mind-networks-modelling), a new understanding of what zettelkasten is offered  from a neuroscience perspective.

Effectively, there is a distinction between the brain and the mind. The brain undergoes neurobiological processes, but there is currently no way to directly map these processes to mental processes, and thus there is no way to map the brain network to the mind network.

> "What I call a mind network is the conceptual layer or thought processes and ideas generated by our brains."

That is to say, mind networks are currently the best form of mapping the mind and understanding the mind. In this sense, a zettelkasten *is* a map of a mind network. 

This is especially relevant when thinking about how [[note-taking is a form of thinking]].

A quote from [[B-How To Take Smart Notes]] illustrates the coupling between the mind and the slip box, although he seems to make the category mistake that Anne-Laure explains in the linked note above:
> We use the same mental models, theories and terms to organise our thoughts in our brains as in our slip-box. That the slip-box generates an excess of possibilities enables it to surprise and inspire us to generate new ideas and develop our theories further. It is not the slip-box or our brains alone, but the dynamic between them that makes working with it so productive.
