As Paul Chiusano writes in his infamous essay, the point of programming should be to create *composable programming environments*:
  
> This essay is a call to cast aside the broken machine metaphor and ultimately end the tyranny of applications. Applications can and ultimately should be replaced by _programming environments_, explicitly recognized as such, in which the user interactively creates, executes, inspects and _composes_ programs.
> 
> [...] the goal of software should not be to build machines, but to build pleasing, accessible programming environments that delight and inspire our users to creation while facilitating the sharing and reuse of programming ideas!

As a developer, I get to experience first hand the joy of working with composable programming environments. I get to ideate and conceptualize program functionality and have a nearly limitless reservoir of libraries that I can combine together into precisely what I want. 

Why can't non-programmers have similar experiences? Why can't people who want to activate some online community for a specific purpose *compose* a bunch of easy to use libraries/modules (like calendars, event scheduling, decision making, chat, project management, collaborative financing, resource sharing, and so on)?

It seems like an arbitrary distinction to limit such programming experiences to coders. Perhaps the constraint is an emergent consequence of our socio-economic matrix that drives software development. From a technical perspective, though, I don't think there are any significant barriers to creating such environments. In fact, this seems to be exactly what [Neighbourhoods](https://docs.neighbourhoods.network/) is attempting to create.

App development and deployment could be occurring and much smaller and more contextual scales ([[holochain enables applications to be designed around the social context in which they will be used rather than being monolithic platforms that groups need to conform to]]). Community members themselves provide the distributed computing infrastructure for the programs to run on. In this sense, the software lifecycle of modern platforms and dev-ops could shift to **vertically integrated, community-centric coordination environments**.
