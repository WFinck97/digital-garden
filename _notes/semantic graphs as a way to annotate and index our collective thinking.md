Imagine a world where most content (podcasts, articles, books) have a complimentary, interactive zettelkasten-like graph mapping the main ideas and concepts. Imagine how much easier it would be to track the main points and internalize whatever insight or knowledge is being shared. Not only that, people could offer their own thoughts and feedback, contributing to the graph (instead of a linear comment thread).

I believe that zettelkasten-like annotations, which are nodes in a graph, perhaps with computable semantics enabled by [[IEML]], would significantly enhance our ability to collectively process and synthesize the vast amounts of quality content out there. 

Basically, I want to live in a world where when I listen to an amazing podcast, I can contribute my own interpretation and insight and connect it with any other insight that other people have gathered, via the graph. Perhaps this could be the new sense-making medium.

We need tools that maximize [[the cognitive ratcheting effect of generative HCI]], and considering that [[a graph is the most flexible, intuitive and least restrictive data structure for working with digital information]], semantic graphs are a great candidate.

In fact, this kind of system could potentially change the entire process of writing, in the sense that it is more about stringing semantic nodes together, branching them, contradicting them, so on and so forth. If the system could ensure provenance of authorship of nodes (and connections too), what would publishing and authoring even look like?

It seems like [swarmcheck](https://www.swarmcheck.ai/) is working on at least the collaborative graph mapping aspect.
