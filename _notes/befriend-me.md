Hey there. Interested in making a new friend?

Making friends can be hard and requires intentional time and effort. Maintaining friendships is just as difficult, if not more. However, so much of what makes life meaningful comes from deep friendships and other forms of social relationships - so they are more than worth the effort!

Of course, our social ties also shape our identity: [[our identity-shaping social relationships are made up of a tiny fraction of the total possible relationships]].

If that hasn't weirded you out yet, maybe we'll get along: [schedule a friendly hangout](https://calendly.com/wesleyfinck/meet).
