Considering that [[long-form arguments are just strings of evergreen notes]], creating these strings of notes is really important. Navigating trails of relationships can give a good sense of note clusters, but an explicit outline will explicitly state all related notes.

The outline document can then serve as a template for writing projects, making it clear where the gaps in ideas still are. Eventually, as notes are written over time and are added to outline documents, they will become populated enough to the point that turning them into some writing project would require only a modest amount of work.
