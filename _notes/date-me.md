Hi there stranger 👋

Welcome to my "date me" page. I know. Weird, right?

But, let me explain.

We all know how limited dating profiles are at representing our personalities accurately. This page is my way of adding a 🤌 *pinch of personal spice* 🤌 to my otherwise bland dating profiles.

Over time, I'll add some of my thoughts around dating and relationships. For now, though, feel free to [schedule a date](https://calendly.com/wesleyfinck/meet) with me ("wow so professional!") or explore some of my crazy thoughts elsewhere on this website ("is this guy okay?").

I can also be found on instagram [@weswalla](https://www.instagram.com/weswalla/) or twitter [@wesleyfinck](https://twitter.com/wesleyfinck) (although I don't think anyone really flirts over on twitter).

Yep, this webpage really exists.

Stay 🌶️
