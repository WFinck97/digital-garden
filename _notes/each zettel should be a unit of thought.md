#zettelkasten 


---
For my zettelkasten to compound in value over time, each zettel needs to be able to contribute to a train thought productively and fluidly. These zettels need to be the building blocks of longer trains of thought, because  [[long-form arguments are just strings of evergreen notes]].

The title of the zettel aims to concisely capture the main thought or idea of the note, while [[facts, examples, and stories go in the content of a zettel]], which can backup the idea, thought, or claim.

By focusing on making a zettel a  *unit of thought*, it can help with the process of [[forging evergreen notes from literature notes]], as I will know what kind of insight/knowledge I am trying to distill from content and what kind of notes I should be writing.

**What is a unit of thought?**
- a declarative statement
- a statement
- a claim
- a declaration
- a cause and/or effect
- a hypothesis
- a process

**What a unit of thought doesn't need to be:**
- a factoid
- an example
- a story
- data

All of these can rather live in the content to support the thought.
