title: attention economy
---

The part of the economy where businesses and individuals profit from capturing and selling attention, predominantly fueled by ad-based revenue models.

Well explored and explained by [The Social Dilemma](https://www.thesocialdilemma.com/) documentary by the [Center for Humane Technology](https://www.humanetech.com/).

The widespread, society-wide negative impacts are deeper than we might initially think: [[the broad impacts of the attention economy's perverse incentives alters widespread communication patterns]].

I've written in great detail explaining the basics of the attention economy and explore several individual steps that can be taken to counteract the individual harms: [A Practical Guide to Minimizing Big Tech Manipulation and Fostering Intellectual Development](https://wesleyfinck.medium.com/a-practical-guide-to-minimizing-big-tech-manipulation-and-fostering-intellectual-development-ecca0130e41d). In it I write a bit about how [[PKM is an antidote to the attention economy]].
