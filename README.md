# Digital garden repository
This is the repository which contains all the notes and code to create my digital garden, available at [wesleyfinck.org](wesleyfinck.org).

# references
To set this up, I followed the guide at [Setting up your own digital garden with Jekyll](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) and forked the template directory available here: https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template
