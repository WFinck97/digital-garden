# Biography

I'm a fullstack developer and entrepreneur working on distributed web applications and knowledge management systems. Currently, I'm helping build a DeSci product that makes it easy for scientists to FAIRify their social media data and turn them into semantic nanopulications. You can learn more about this project [here](https://sense-nets.xyz/).

I'm fascinated by tools-for-thought and the way they can shape our relationship to knowledge and notes. On that front I've been experimenting with RAG-pipelines in the context of a personal knowledge base for the purpose of resurfaces prior notes in contextually relevant ways, helping people leverage their past writing without the overhead of expert-user workflows. This builds on the insights gained from the research project [Scaling Synthesis](https://scalingsynthesis.com/).

I've also worked extensively with [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org), a distributed application framework offering a new way to build and deploy applications that are scalable, secure, and interoperable. My work with Holochain has been primarily focused on building social sense-making applications and economic coordination systems, including [Coasys](https://coasys.org/), [Neighbourhoods](https://neighbourhoods.network/), and [hREA](https://hrea.io/). Please visit my [github profile](https://github.com/weswalla/) for a full list of the various open-source projects I have contributed to over the years.

Overall, I'm passionate about the future of an open internet and continue to explore the most promising open-source technologies and protocols that can help us get there. If you're interested in collaborating on a project, please reach out via any of the contact methods below.

I also love listening to podcasts and they are one of the main ways I continue to expand my understanding of the world. Checkout a list of my favourites here: [[podcasts]].

I am interested in learning, knowledge management & synthesis, collective epistemic processes, sense-making, and the digital tools that can enhance these activities.

# about this site

I am primarily using this site as a space to share my writing and research on various topics, which is structured as a digital garden. You can explore my [[digital garden]] by following the link and navigating my notes as a graph.
