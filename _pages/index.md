# about me
ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, welcome to my site. 

## professional
I'm an independent contractor specializing in [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org/) development and distributed/interoperable application design. I'm currently working with [Sprillow](https://sprillow.com) and [Lightning Rod Labs](https://lightningrodlabs.org/) on a number of projects, including [Acorn](http://acorn.software/), one of the most mature holochain applications, and [hREA](https://hrea.io/), a post-capitalism economic coordination and accounting framework build on Holochain. I'm also working with the [Perspect3vism](https://github.com/perspect3vism/) team to develop infrastructure that will support an [agent-centric, distributed, and interoperable web](https://medium.com/holochain/holochain-reinventing-applications-d2ac1e4f25ef). You can find more of my development work by visiting my [github profile](https://github.com/weswalla/).

I enjoy reading, writing, filmmaking and generally communicating challenging topics in accessible ways. You can explore some of my personal work by visiting my:
- [medium profile](https://wesleyfinck.medium.com/)
- [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPMZ2h9TqvfWIAQyFGfPyEQ)
- [[digital garden]]

I am interested in learning, knowledge management & synthesis, collective epistemic processes, sense-making, and the digital tools that can enhance these activities.
