# Wesley Finck
Hey there, welcome to my site. Currently, I'm a software developer developing [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org/) applications with [Sprillow](https://sprillow.com).
My interests span many subjects, but at the moment I am most interested in distributed, interoperable communication and collaboration software systems.
I am also very passionate about understanding and teaching complex topics and am always exploring creative forms of expression to help with these pursuits.

# About this Site
This site is under active development and may be a bit clunky.
Most of what there is to explore is my [[digital garden]], which is where I would direct your attention :)
