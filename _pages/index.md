# about me
ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, welcome to my site. 

## professional
I'm an independent contractor specializing in [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org/) development and distributed/interoperable application design. I'm currently working with [Sprillow](https://sprillow.com) on a number of projects, including [Acorn](https://github.com/h-be/acorn), one of the most mature holochain applications. I'm also working with the [Perspect3vism](https://github.com/perspect3vism/) team to develop infrastructure that will support an [agent-centric, distributed, and interoperable web](https://medium.com/holochain/holochain-reinventing-applications-d2ac1e4f25ef). One of the projects I am working on through this collaboration is [Clutter](https://github.com/artbrock/clutter), a fully distributed twitter alternative. You can find more of my development work by visiting my [github profile](https://github.com/weswalla/).
